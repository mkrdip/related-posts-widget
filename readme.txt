function cruise_shortcode_iconship( $html ) {
	return "prefix-" . $html . "-suffix";
}
add_filter( 'widget_title', 'cruise_shortcode_iconship' );

= The feature image dimention are not correctly displayed? =
Enable the option "Use CSS cropping". This option don't care about stored setting (Settings > Media) or added image sizes. [What is 'CSS feature image cropping'](http://tiptoppress.com/css-image-crop/)?

= Excerpt length filter doesn't works =
When a post has no manual excerpt WordPress generates an excerpt automatically by selecting the first 55 words of the post or the first words number setted by the excerpt filter length. This means the excerpt length filter works only with automatic excerpt. If you manually added an excerpt, you'd want it all to be shown.
